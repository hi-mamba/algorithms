# 202. Happy Number


## 题目：

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number
```
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
 

## 题解：

判断一个数字是否为Happy Number。这道题跟求无限循环小数很像，最好维护一个HashSet，
假如遇见重复，则返回false。否则替换n为digits square root sum，当n == 1时循环结束返回true。

Time Complexity - O(n)， Space Complexity - O(n)。
